# zcpu3D

3D software rendering application made in Zig using RGFW (props to them). (not working yet, I just pushed almost empty project)

This is just experiment, nothing serious.
Can be builded only on Linux for now (tested on Arch btw). Just clone repository and build using `make` and run using `make run`.
