# zcpu3D

3D software rendering application made in Zig using RGFW. ***not working yet, I just pushed almost empty project***

This is just experiment, nothing serious.
Can be builded only on Linux for now (tested on Arch btw). Just clone repository and build using `make` and run using `make run`.

## Used technologies:
- [RGFW](https://github.com/ColleagueRiley/RGFW)
- [olive.c](https://github.com/tsoding/olive.c)
